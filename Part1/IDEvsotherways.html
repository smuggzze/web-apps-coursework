                <h2 class="headingFonts">Why IDEs?</h2>
                <p>Why would you want to choose to program with an IDE rather than with a text editor or in-line client?
                    There are many reasons as to why one would choose the IDE over any other options. IDEs provide the user with
                    access to many resources that would be missed if they were to use any other options. These resources include automatic
                    formatting, keyword highlighting, autocomplete and syntax checking to name a few.<br>
                    <br>
                    Automatic formatting is a brilliant feature as it helps with indentation of code which greatly increases readability.
                    In languages like java, code indentation is not required for the code its self to be executed, but without indentation, 
                    it is very difficult to read. For languages such an python however, code indentation is very important, therefore this is
                    a very helpful feature. If one was to use a text editor, indentation would be entirely manual. The text editor may not even
                    support the use of the "tab" key to create an indentation block, which would force the user to use the space bar to unreliably 
                    indent their code.<br>
                    <br>
                    Keyword highlighting is another feature that improves readability, by colouring important words and data types
                    the user is able to see the difference between keywords. This also helps with debugging as through the use of colours the
                    user may be able to identify mistakes in their code. If the user was to use a text editor, they may be able to highlight their
                    code in some way either manually or automatically if it is a text editor with added features, but again, they will be missing out
                    on useful features.<br>
                    <br>
                    Text editors may include an autocomplete function, but this is not neccessarily helpful, it may even be a disadvantage,
                    as the user may be forced into autocompleting their text to things they didnt want. Autocomplete in IDEs is more specialised,
                    syntax is understood and keywords are identified for autocomplete, some IDEs use predictive algorithms to understand the
                    keywords that the user makes use of most for better autocompletion. various extentions can be downloaded to improve autocompletion
                    in IDEs, AI autocompleters which learn your coding patterns can really help with efficiency. These ai are fead huge amounts of data
                    to make the user's experience far easier.<br>
                    <br>
                    Syntax checking is something that is exclusive to IDEs, text editors unless heavily modified, will not be able to do this. it
                    works similarly to spell checkers in apps like microsoft word, wrong syntax is highlighted to the user, usually with red underlines.
                    or if the code is executed, they will be pointed to the lines in the code where the error occured. Text editors lack this feature
                    entirely, which again reinforces why one would choose to ue an IDE over a text editor.<br>
                    <br>
                    Text editors are not all bad. They are simple to use, usually don't take up much storage, and if experienced in coding with 
                    a text editor, the user may be very efficient. Despite this, an IDE is definitely recommended due to the help it provides. 
                    some users may suggest that the lack of help in text editors is better for one's learning. While this may be true for them, 
                    it is not for most people.<br>
                    <br>
                    To conclude, Text editors are a good baseline for coding due to the ease of access to them (usually available on every device), 
                    but they do not neccessarily help the user with their coding, and may actually damage their efforts to be efficient. This is why,
                    if possible, it is advised to download an IDE. IDEs are dedicated platforms for coding, this is an obvious sign as to why one should
                    use one over a text editor, the help they provide is incredibly beneficial. Choose to use an IDE.

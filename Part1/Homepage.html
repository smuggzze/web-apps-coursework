                    <p>Integrated Development Environments or (IDEs) are integral to modern coding efficiency.
                        They provide users with an incredible set of tools which allow the practice of coding to be simplified.
                        These tools range from spell check to plugins which are used and loved by most IDE users. IDEs also provide
                        a  code editor, compiler and or interpreter which improves accessibility of coding to a wider range of users, this is because
                        there is a reduced complexiy in getting started. Using an IDE will most likely minimise the amount of seperate files and
                        applications the user needs to download.<br>
                        <br>
                        version control is a very important feature of IDEs which helps the user manage (delete, update and assess) all
                        the iterations of their code. some IDEs may store local recent changes to code or house a recently deleted file section
                        where the user is able to retrieve accidentally removed files. another way version control is used within IDEs is with 
                        3rd party platforms such as git and github. These platforms store repositaries of the users code in a cloud based system
                        which is accessible to all memebers of a team.

                        <td>Syntax Checking</td>
                        <td>For the language that is being written, errors in syntax will be checked. If an error is found, the user will
                            usually be notified by a certain colour highlight or underline performed by the IDE. Helps the user avoid common errors.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Runtime environment</td>
                        <td>The program is run by having its source code eithr compiled or interpreted into machine code allowing the CPU to execute it.
                            this is useful as it allows the user to run their code without having to use system apps like cmd prompt or other command line interfaces which can be quite confusing.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Debug mode</td>
                        <td>This mode is seperate to the standard runtime env, it allows the user to see step by step how certain functions work,
                            which they may either have written themselves or be inbuilt in the language. errors are more easily highlighted in this mode,
                            Therefore making debugging alot easier.
                        </td>

                    <tr>
                        <td>Break point</td>
                        <td>Another feature that assists in debugging. Breakpoints stop the code when run in debug mode, at the point where they were placed.
                            This will allow the user to see the values of variables at certain points during execution, the user may also be able to trace through 
                            the code line by line and watch as the varables are updated or used throughout the code.

                        Visual studio code (VS code) is a very versatile IDE.
                        It provides users with the ability to use any language they desire, as long as that language has a plugin that allows VS code to understand said language.
                        A very popular IDE, Recommended for all.</p>

                        </a>
                        For those who wish for a more hands on approach, Atom is good for the job.
                        It is about as bare bones as IDEs get, which allows for the ultimate customistation of one's
                        workspace. Not recommended for beginners, but for those who are experienced and want the least
                        intrusion from their IDE, this is most likely the best bet for you.</p>
